# CS 375 Group Project

Weighted activity selection problem: implement an algorithm using dynamic programming.


Each Oral Presentation should cover the following aspects:

1. Algorithm Purpose: Clearly describe the problem that your algorithm is designed to solve. Use an example to
illustrate the problem, if possible.

2. Algorithm: Describe the basic idea of the algorithm; show and describe pseudo-code. Your pseudo-code should
be in the style of the text book, should be extremely neat and clear, and should use enough abstraction so that
it fits on one slide.

3. Algorithm Analysis: What are the interesting features of the algorithm? What is its time complexity, and why?

4. Implementation: What language did you use for your implementation? Discuss key data structures, classes,
and functions used in the implementation.

5. Problem Statement: What question did you set out to answer about your algorithm? Why is this an interesting and
important question? (Note that you may choose to include this part of your presentation earlier or later in your
talk, depending on your project.)

6. Demo: A short demonstration of your program. Have this ready to go; do not waste time “setting up.” You may
decide to provide static screen shots and sample output instead of running your program “live”, to ensure a
smooth presentation.

7. Experimental Plan: Describe the dataset that you used to test the algorithm. How did you generate it? What
characteristics does it have, and why? What did you decide to vary in the input set, and why?

8. Results: What did you learn from testing your algorithm?

9. Limitations and Future Work: What limitations does your project currently exhibit? If you had another month to
work on the project, how would you improve your project? What additional tests would you run?

10. Concluding remarks and discuss role of each group member.
